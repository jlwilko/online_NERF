# Towards Online NeRF

## Setup

Create virtual environment for the visual odometry in the `vo/monoVO-python/` directory:

```bash
cd vo/monoVO-python/
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# What have I done

- more playing around with visual odometry 
- fixed issue where resolution was very low = i was just downsampling by 10x after an initial investigation so nws there
- prepping results so expectations for those next week

- instantNGP on the way, no real roadblocks but just haven't put in the time yet
