# Towards Online NeRF

## Setup

The first step is to clone the thirdparty repositories under the `thirdparty` directory. Run the below commands:

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/luigifreda/pyslam.git
git checkout ubuntu20
```

Then initially to build the virtual environment: `. install_all_venv.sh`

Once build, activation is as follows: `. pyenv-activate.sh` and `deactivate` to exit

# What have I done

- more playing around with visual odometry 
- fixed issue where resolution was very low = i was just downsampling by 10x after an initial investigation so nws there
- prepping results so expectations for those next week

- instantNGP on the way, no real roadblocks but just haven't put in the time yet
